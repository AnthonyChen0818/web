<h2> What are Sharks? </h2>
 <p> Sharks are a type of carnivorous fish. They have been on the Earth for over 400 million years, making them older than the dinosaurs. They belong to a group of “elasmobranch fish”, specifically characterized by their skeletons made of cartilage, five to seven gill slits on each side of the body, and pectoral fins not fused to their bodies. They are carnivores, eating other live organisms to survive. Sharks can be found in almost all parts of the world. Some species thrive in freshwater, whereas others thrive in saltwater. They are closely related to species such as stingrays, skates, and chimaeras. </p>
